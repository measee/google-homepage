# Project From The Odin Project's Web Development 101
(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
The task is to use what I've learned so far about HTML and CSS to create Google's main page.
The page I created is static and has no working links or search function.
The biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to use flexbox vs. block display to place elements in the right place. The code that worked for the top navigation bar didn't work exactly the same for the bottom navigation bar.
I learned that what seems like a simple page can actually involve a lot of code.
